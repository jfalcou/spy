# Purpose

Detection and versioning of operating systems, compilers, architecture and other element are
traditionally done using preprocessor macros. Library like
[Boost.Predef](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/predef.html) provides a sanitized
interface on top of those but still live in a world where the preprocessor is king.

SPY is a C++17 (and onward) library that gathers similar information and provides a `constexpr`
compatible interface to access those information, thus making their exploitation within `constexpr`
context possible.

# How to install

## Using CMake

After cloning the repository, run `CMake` with an install prefix path then run the `install` target
using `Make` or any other build system.

~~~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/jfalcou/spy.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/folder
make install
~~~~~

## Manually

After cloning the repository, copy the `spy.hpp` file into the folder of your choice.

~~~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/jfalcou/spy.git
cp -r include/spy.hpp path/to/install/folder
~~~~~

## Sample usage
SPY is usable by simply including the `spy.hpp` file as demonstrated here:

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << spy::operating_system      << std::endl;
  std::cout << spy::architecture          << std::endl;
  std::cout << spy::simd_instruction_set  << std::endl;
  std::cout << spy::compiler              << std::endl;
  std::cout << spy::libc                  << std::endl;
  std::cout << spy::stdlib                << std::endl;
}
~~~~~
</script>

Just compile this example using a C++17 compliant compiler.
Don't forget to add the path to the SPY library file to your favorite compiler's options.

## Redistribuable include

If you want to use SPY in your own project but want to keep a low imprint on your own source code,
one can copy the single `spy.hpp` file provided at the root of the include folder.

# User manual

## Supported detectors
SPY can detect:

- Architecture family via the `spy::architecture` object.
- Supported SIMD extension sets
- OS vendor via the `spy::operating_system` object.
- Compiler vendor and version (in the M.N.P format) via the `spy::compiler` object.
- libc vendor and version (in the M.N.P format) via the `spy::libc` object.
- stdlib vendor and version (in the M.N.P format) via the `spy::stdlib` object.

The simplest usage of those objects is to pass them to an output stream to get
a readable display of their information.

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << spy::operating_system      << "\n";
  std::cout << spy::simd_instruction_set  << "\n";
  std::cout << spy::architecture          << "\n";
  std::cout << spy::compiler              << "\n";
  std::cout << spy::stdlib                << "\n";
  std::cout << spy::libc                  << "\n";
}

## Comparing vendors

### Main Information

Knowing is half the battle, we may want to compare the current compiler or OS to a given one
so you can branch off your code based on this information. Here is the list of each detected
vendor for each SPY objects.

| Detector                | Supported vendor                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spy::architecture`     | `x86_`, `amd64_`, `ppc_`, `arm_`                                               |
| `spy::operating_system` | `android_`, `bsd_`, `cygwin_`, `ios_`, `linux_`, `macos_`, `unix_`, `windows_` |
| `spy::compiler`         | `clang_`, `gcc_`, `intel_`, `msvc_`, `emscripten_`                             |
| `spy::libc`             | `cloudabi_`, `gnu_` `uc_`, `vms_`, `zos_`                                      |
| `spy::stdlib`           | `gnucpp_`, `libcpp_`                                                           |

Here is a sample code comparing some detectors to a specific vendor:

[**Run it on Compiler Explorer**](https://godbolt.org/z/8rz9q84Ez)

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  if constexpr( spy::operating_system == spy::windows_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code is Windows only.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::compiler == spy::gcc_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with g++.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::architecture == spy::amd64_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled on AMD64 architecture.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::stdlib == spy::libcpp_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code uses libcpp as its standard library implementation.\n";
  }
}
~~~~~
</script>

### Other Informations

Additional features can be checked using the `spy::supports` namespace:

 - Checking for POSIX capability via `spy::supports::posix_`

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  if constexpr( spy::supports::posix_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This is a POSIX platform.\n";
  }
}
~~~~~
</script>

 - Checking for status of address and threads sanitizers via `spy::supports::sanitizers_status`,
   `spy::supports::address_sanitizers_status` and `spy::supports::thread_sanitizers_status`.
   `spy::supports::sanitizers_status` is set to true if either `spy::supports::address_sanitizers_status`
   or `spy::supports::thread_sanitizers_status` is true.

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Address sanitizers status: "
            << std::boolalpha << spy::supports::address_sanitizers_status
            << "\n";

  std::cout << "Threads sanitizers status: "
            << std::boolalpha << spy::supports::thread_sanitizers_status
            << "\n";

  std::cout << "Any sanitizers status: "
            << std::boolalpha << spy::supports::sanitizers_status << "\n";
}
~~~~~
</script>
## Comparing versions

Checking for a vendor is sometimes not enough, we need to check which version of a given
component is used. To do this, you can compare a detector to a given version value using
any comparison operators.

Versions are build using a custom literal suffix based on the vendor name (`_vendor`)
and a series of integral values separated by `'`.

| Detector        | Supported version suffixes                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spy::compiler` | `_clang`, `_gcc`, `_intel`, `_msvc`, `_em`                                     |
| `spy::libc`     | `_cloudabi`, `_gnu` `_uc`, `_vms`, `_zos`                                      |
| `spy::stdlib`   | `_gnucpp`, `_libcpp`                                                           |

The following code demonstrates such comparisons:

[**Run it on Compiler Explorer**](https://godbolt.org/z/hhxh5r5q9)

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  using namespace spy::literal;

  if constexpr( spy::compiler == 11'2_gcc )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with g++ 11.2 exactly.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::compiler >= 8_clang )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with clang++ 8 or above.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::stdlib < 4'0'1_libcpp )
  {
    std::cout << "This code uses libcpp below v4.0.1.\n";
  }
}
~~~~~
</script>

## Handling SIMD extensions

### Instructions sets
SIMD extensions set detection is made so that one can ask if the current SIMD extension is exactly,
below or above a given reference instruction set. Detectable instructions sets depends on SIMD
hardware vendor

| Architecture  | Supported SIMD instructions sets                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X86           | `sse1_`, `sse2_`, `sse3_`, `ssse3_`, `sse41_`, `sse42_`, `avx_`, `avx2_`, `avx512_` |
| Power PC      | `vmx_`, `vsx_`                                                                      |
| ARM           | `neon_`,`asimd_`,`sve_`,`sve128_`,`sve256_`,`sve512_`,`sve1024_`                    |
| WASM          | `simd128_`                                                                          |

Complete set of comparison operators is provided for those sets. Order of instructions sets
are built so that if an instructions set supersedes another, it is considered greater than. For
example, `avx_` is greater than `sse41_` as the former is a super-set of the later.

Moreover, the `spy::simd_instruction_set` object exposes a constexpr `width` static field that
contains the size in bits of the current SIMD instructions set registers.

[**Run it on Compiler Explorer**](https://godbolt.org/z/Wj9PE9ahP)

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  if constexpr( spy::simd_instruction_set == spy::avx_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with AVX instructions set.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::simd_instruction_set >= spy::sse41_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with at least support for SSE 4.1\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::simd_instruction_set <= spy::sse2_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with support for SSE2 at most.\n";
  }

  std::cout << "This code can use " << spy::simd_instruction_set.width << " bits register.\n";
}
~~~~~
</script>

### SIMD Architectures
One can also simply asks if a given family of instructions set is available.

[**Run it on Compiler Explorer**](https://godbolt.org/z/Pn5TrePMo)

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  if constexpr( spy::simd_instruction_set == spy::x86_simd_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with some Intel SIMD instructions set.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::simd_instruction_set == spy::arm_simd_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with some ARM SIMD instructions set.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::simd_instruction_set == spy::ppc_simd_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with some Power PC SIMD instructions set.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::simd_instruction_set == spy::wasm_simd_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with WASM enabled.\n";
  }
}
~~~~~
</script>

### Supplemental Instructions sets
Some SIMD instructions set provides supplemental instructions on top of existing system.
Those supplemental instruction set can be checked using the `spy::supports` namespace.

[**Run it on Compiler Explorer**](https://godbolt.org/z/36K8bvrxK)

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  if constexpr( spy::supports::fma_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with FMA3 support.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::supports::fma4_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with FMA4 support.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::supports::xop_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with XOP support.\n";
  }

  if constexpr( spy::supports::avx512::cd_ )
  {
    std::cout << "This code has been compiled with AV512-CD support.\n";
  }
}
~~~~~
</script>

The complete list of supplemental instruction sets si given in the following table.

| Architecture  | Supported SIMD instructions sets                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X86 AVX       | `xop_`, `fma_`, `fma4_`                                                                                                         |
| X86 AVX512    | `avx512::bw_`, `avx512::cd_`, `avx512::dq_`, `avx512::er_`, `avx512::ifma_`, `avx512::pf_`, `avx512::vl_`, `avx512::popcntdq_`, `avx512::_4fmaps_`, `avx512::vnniw_`, `avx512::vbmi_`, `avx512::bf16_`, `avx512::bitalg_`, `avx512::vbmi2_`, `avx512::vnni_`, `avx512::vpintersect_`                  |

# Caveat with `if constexpr`

The detection and comparisons of versions using SPY detectors are subject to some
caveats that stem from the way `if constexpr` behaves. As both branch of the `if constexpr`
are ODR_checked, all functions and type names must be defined even if not used. This means
that this can't compile whatsoever:

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>

template<typename T> auto f(T t)
{
  if constexpr( spy::clang_ )
  {
    return __builtin_bitreverse32(t);
  }
  else if constexpr( spy::gcc_ )
  {
    return __builtin_bswap32(t);
  }
}
~~~~~
</script>

Post C++20, we advice you to use concepts with template functions:

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~ c++
#include <spy.hpp>

template<typename T> auto f(T t) requires( spy::clang_ )
{
  return __builtin_bitreverse32(t);
}

template<typename T> auto f(T t) requires( spy::gcc_ )
{
  return __builtin_bswap32(t);
}
~~~~~
