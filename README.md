# C++ Informations Broker

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jfalcou/spy.svg?style=svg&circle-token=91ebbf06adfe257ebdff3a5ed17ea512fe02771c)](https://circleci.com/gh/jfalcou/spy) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3us8906c0lvdl8ld/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jfalcou/spy/branch/develop)

# Purpose
Detection and versioning of operating systems, compilers, architecture and other element are
traditionally done using preprocessor macros. Library like
[Boost.Predef](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/predef.html) provides a sanitized
interface on top of those but still live in a world where the preprocessor is king.

SPY is a C++17 (and onward) library that gathers similar informations and provides a `constexpr`
compatible interface to access those information, thus making their exploitation within `constexpr`
context possible.

The complete [documentation can be found here](https://jfalcou.github.io/spy).
